# Music Runner

This is the repository for the F15 CEN4914 term project (Senior Project) for Bernard Marger (@bern422) and Troy Gittelmacher (@tgittelmacher). Music Runner is a cross-platform run-and-game that uses user-uploaded music to generate level layouts and enemy patterns, much like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard. This is still in progress - stay tuned for updates!
